# Requirements

* PHP â‰¥ 7.0

This package is tested on the most recent stable releases of [Zend PHP](http://php.net/) versions 7.0 and 7.1, plus the latest version of [HHVM](http://hhvm.com/) available for the Ubuntu operating system. HHVM must be running in full [PHP 7 mode](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/configuration/INI-settings#php-7-settings).

```ini
hhvm.php7.all = 1
```

This package is developed for the [Nirvarnia](https://www.nirvarnia.org/) framework but it can be used independently.
